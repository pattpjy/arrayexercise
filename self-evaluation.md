How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
Pretty confident, I feel like I have better grasp on array and method than I have with git and github.
Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
I need to look into more methods and place(website) I can use as a reference.
What questions do you have about Arrays?
if I add string number in an array, is there a way to convert those string into number?
